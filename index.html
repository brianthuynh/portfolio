        <h2> A little bit about me: </h2>
        <p>
            I am a student at UC San Diego majoring in Data Science and minoring in Cognitive Science. I have a deep interest in fields such as Sports Analytics and Computational Neuroscience. I aspire to work in those fields and be a part of a team that takes an ethical approach to help extract insights and uncover hidden patterns from data.
            Outside of data science, I've held teaching positions as a tutor and high school coach. I enjoyed every bit of it as it helped train my communication skills and develop an open-minded approach to how individuals learn.
            I am currently seeking opportunities in positions where I can leverage my skills and interests to make a meaningful impact.
        </p>
        <h2> Outside of School: </h2>
        <li>I enjoy activities like running, lifiting, and swimming. </li> 
        <li>I love watching football, basketball, and water polo</li>
        <li>Fun Fact: I want to run a half-marathon this year</li>
